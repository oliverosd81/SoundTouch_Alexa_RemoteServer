# An Experimental Alexa Skill for SoundTouch - Remote Server Component
## Overview
This repository contains one of the three components necessary enable Alexa to control Bose SoundTouch speakers. The other two required components are:
+ [AlexaSoundTouch\_AlexaSkill](https://github.com/zwrose/AlexaSoundTouch_AlexaSkill) 
+ [AlexaSoundTouch\_LocalServer](https://github.com/zwrose/AlexaSoundTouch_LocalServer) 

This Remote Server Component serves as a bridge between the AlexaSoundTouch\_AlexaSkill and AlexaSoundTouch\_LocalServer to avoid the need for port-forwarding or other custom firewall modifications.
